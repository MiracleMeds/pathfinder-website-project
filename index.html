            </h2>
            <p>
                Action Lib is a tool used to help players of the tabletop roleplaying game
                Pathfinder Second Edition keep track of their possible actions during combat.
                Pathfinder's combat can be extremely overwhelming for new players and a character
                sheet can only fit so much information! Now, lets lighten that load!

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                As Action Lib stands as of right now, only the "Actions" and "Glossary" sections work correctly.
                I plan to implement a login feature so that users can keep preferences (Such as favoriting certain actions)
                and way more available actions to choose from. So treat this website as a prototype.<br><br>
                If you know your way around JavaScript, I added a "mock database", where all the actions are currently held.
                If you go into the scripts folder there is a file called "mockDatabase.js". You can add a couple of actions 
                using the structure I have layed out. Copy/Paste the layout template from the comments and fill it out. 
                I'd suggest leaving the "traits" section empty (traits: "",) as currently it requires a url to work.
                <br><br>
                Once you filled out your action, paste the const name into the imports list at the bottom of mockDatabase and 
                go ahead and open the file "actionAssembler.js". add your new const to the import list on line 1 and add it to the 
                array on line 24. <br><br>
                And you're good to go!
                <br><br>
                This feature of manually writing the code into the database like this is <i>not</i> the intended way of using this
                webpage and I will later have a way to add on your own custom actions later on. For now though, I wanted to present 
                the option if you're so inclined.

            <p>The functionality for this section is currently not implemented so for now this section will be left blank.</p>

            <p>
                These websites work well in unison with Action Lib. They are fantastic resources for anyone who 
                plays Pathfinder Second Edition. If you've never used these before check them out!

                    The official wikipedia for Pathfinder Second Edition! A completely free website designed to allow anyone access
                    to all of Pathfinder's rules for any expansion! While they don't give you access to any books themselves, they are
                    an amazing tool to learn Pathfinder 2e for free. It has all players/GMs need to get started!

                    <p>
                        Pathbuilder is a great tool for making free character sheets online easily and quickly. The site does most of the heavy lifting
                        when it comes to making a charater, automatically adding bonuses and calculating scores whenever you choose your featues.
                        Pathbuilder also has access to all Pathfinder 2e expansions, letting you choose from any features you'd want for free!

                        Pathfinder Nexus is a website that combines the previous two resources with a more approachable format.
                        They allow you to buy digital versions of Pathfinder's books through their website, allowing you to read
                        them from anywhere. They have a character builder as well but you are restricted to only a couple of options
                        Pathfinder Nexus gives for free. You need to own the digital copies of the Pathfinder books to use the options
                        listed in them.
